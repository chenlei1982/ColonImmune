Codes for analtzing the scRNA-seq data of immune cells from patients with COVID-19

In this respository, codes form analyzing the scRNA-seq data of immune cells from patients with COVID-19 are provided. These codes implement four featrue ranking algorithms: last absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), light gradient boosting ma-chine (LightGBM), Monte Carlo feature selection (MCFS), and max-relevance and min-redundancy (mRMR), and three classification algiorithms: decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and random forest.
